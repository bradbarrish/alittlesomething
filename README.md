# What is this?
A Little Something is a project I've been working on since my kids were born. It's an attempt to collect a bunch of stuff in digital form that represents my values, captures my thoughts and otherwise allows my children and future generations to know something authentic about me or at least get a glipse into me as an individual. It's also my first real attempt to work on what I've long been referring to as my digital legacy. I've put this on GitHub so other parents can clone it or be inspired to do something similar for their families.

## Thanks Clio and Dan Romero for making the site easy to update and look nice

Clio is a template and theme based on [danromero.org](https://danromero.org). Like Clio, this repository is designed to be hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). My deploys are done automatically with Netlify. You can read more about the [GitHub Pages + Jekyll integration](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll). Out-of-the-box the template supports:

1. A homepage that displays a brief introduction and the most recent blog posts in reverse chronological order.
2. An about page located at `/about/`.
3. A sample blog post.
4. An RSS feed for all of the blog posts.

## How to set up

1. Clone the repository. Delete `screenshot.png` from the main folder.
2. Edit `_config.yml`. Replace the sample text for title, email, description, url, and twitter.
3. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository's settings. If you are planning to use a custom domain, you can also set that up on the settings page.
4. Add future **posts** as Markdown `(.md)` files to the `_posts` folder. GitHub Pages will automatically generate the HTML.
5. Add future **pages** (like the `/about/` page) as Markdown `(.md)` files to the main folder. GitHub Pages will automatically generate the HTML.
6. **Update the images** in the `/assets/` folder. **If you don't, your site will be represented by a purple square.** ðŸ™‚
67. Add future images to the `/assets/` folder. 

## Open Graph images
The template is set up to support Open Graph images for services like [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/getting-started). Be sure to add the image name in the [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) of the blog posts and the images should be uploaded to the `/assets/og/` folder. The Hello World! sample post has a functioning example.

## Google Analytics
You can add the Javascript into the `default.html` [layout](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/) right above the `</body>` tag.
