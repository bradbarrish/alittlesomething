[John Perry Barlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow) influenced me on a few fronts. First and foremost, he was the lyricist for The Grateful Dead. Cassidy, you are named after your namesake song, which he co-wrote. He was also very involved with the creation of the Internet. It's something we now take for granted, but his activism, especially with the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has been especially impactful on the world.

On August 15, 2013, he participated in [a Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kgmes/i_am_john_perry_barlow_cofounder_of_the/) (Ask Me Anything). They were a thing for a while. Maybe they will still be a thing when you get around to reading this. They are question and answer sessions where participants would post questions and the guest, in this case John Perry Barlow, would answer the questions in a threaded discussion forum. Reddit is still around at the time I am writing this, but it isn't the same as it originally was. Anyway, he shared his "Principles of Adult Behavior" during the AMA. They were originally written in 1977 on the eve of his 30th birthday and have been in circulation ever since. They are fantastic rules! I would encourage you to come up with your own list. 

* Be patient. No matter what.
* Don't badmouth: Assign responsibility, not blame. Say nothing of another you wouldn't say to him.
* Never assume the motives of others are, to them, less noble than yours are to you.
* Expand your sense of the possible.
* Don't trouble yourself with matters you truly cannot change.
* Expect no more of anyone than you can deliver yourself.
* Tolerate ambiguity.
* Laugh at yourself frequently.
* Concern yourself with what is right rather than who is right.
* Never forget that, no matter how certain, you might be wrong.
* Give up blood sports.
* Remember that your life belongs to others as well. Don't risk it frivolously.
* Never lie to anyone for any reason.
* Learn the needs of those around you and respect them.
* Avoid the pursuit of happiness. Seek to define your mission and pursue that.
* Reduce your use of the first personal pronoun.
* Praise at least as often as you disparage.
* Admit your errors freely and soon.
* Become less suspicious of joy.
* Understand humility.
* Remember that love forgives everything.
* Foster dignity.
* Live memorably.
* Love yourself.
* Endure.
