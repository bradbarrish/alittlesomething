> The subliminal message of English class is that good writing needs to be poetic. Students read novels with purple prose and try to replicate it in their five-paragraph essays so they can impress their teachers.

> This obsession with poetic writing is one of the most destructive outcomes of modern writing education. Focus on clear writing instead.

> Basketball provides an analogy. Even if all the stars know how to do fancy dribbles like “through the legs,” the “spin move,” and “behind the back,” you shouldn’t start there. You should master the basic dribbles first. Jumping into advanced dribbles when you start playing basketball is the fastest way to look like a goon and get the ball stolen from you. No matter how fancy their dribbling can become, even the best players focus on basic moves that aren’t impressive but get the job done.

> Focus on writing clearly. Let poetic language be a byproduct of clear writing and don’t even think about lavish prose until you’ve mastered the art of writing clearly.
