> If you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on for too long. Just figure out what’s next.

Make sure you watch [his commencement address at Stanford from 2005](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc). He didn’t really give speeches outside of the presentations he did for Apple and Next, so this was particularly special. It’s also worth noting he gave the speech on my 31st birthday.

Here's a great quote from that address…

> "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition."
