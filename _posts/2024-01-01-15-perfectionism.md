I came across this quote from someone's [blog post](https://tala.bearblog.dev/perfectionism-is-a-form-of-shame/) (I don't know them) and it really hit me and stuck with me.

> Perfectionism often wears the mask of high standards, ambition, discipline. It parades itself as virtue, a propriety. In reality, it is rarely about the pursuit of excellence but the terror of being perceived as inadequate.

> Perfectionism rarely creates perfection. You procrastinate because you’re terrified of falling short. You abandon projects because they don’t live up to insurmountable standards. You spend more time frantically burying flaws than creating something authentic.

I've never really considered myself a perfectionist, but I definitely have some perfectionistic tendencies that, at times, keep me from creating something authentic, trying something I might struggle with. I see signs of this in both of you, though not in the same way.

I'm sure I've expressed this elsewhere, but being able to self-reflect is a skill that I hope you are able to develop as you get older. Just be kind to yourself. We are all imperfect beings. When you are reflecting or examining yourself, make sure you do so with compassion and acceptance, just as you would a good friend.
