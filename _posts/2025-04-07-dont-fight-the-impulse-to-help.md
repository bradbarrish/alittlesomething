You will inevitably be thrown into situations where your impulse will be to rush to someone's side, stop the car to help someone in need or provide assistance to someone that looks like they might need it. Do not fight these impulses. The vast majority of people fight them. They look the other way. They think to themselves, 'Looks like someone else is helping so there's nothing I can do'.  You would be wrong. You can always do something. Don't fight the impulse. Be of service. Give a damn. Help anyone and everyone you can. Take care of your fellow Earthlings. This makes the world a better place. YOU make the world a better place. Don't think for a moment that you do not.
  
I wrote this after reading a post called "[I am sorry. You died last night](https://medium.com/@zibbyz/i-am-sorry-c2751286635c)." about a 26-year-old woman named Kate Slattery that was killed when a car ran a red light and hit her while she was riding her bike.
