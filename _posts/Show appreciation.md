If someone does something you like or something nice for you, thank them — ideally in person. If not in person, then a hand-written note is nice (I know it sounds old-fashioned, but trust me on this).

This was inspired by [Jonathan Pettit's answer](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-advice-your-mother-ever-gave-you-1/answer/Jonathan-Pettit-1) to the question, "what is the best advice your mother ever gave you? Do you feel it has benefited you as an adult?" You should read it, assuming it still exists on the web.
