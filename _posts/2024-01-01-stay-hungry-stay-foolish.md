The image above is a scan of the back cover of the final issue of the Whole Earth Catalog, which was created by the futurist, Stewart Brand. I admire him a great deal. The Whole Earth Catalog is a relic from the 1960s in America and has been described as a sort of World Wide Web in print. You can see most of it on [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/wholeearth). Steve Jobs used this phrase at the end of [his Stanford commencement address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc), which I've linked to in other places as well.
