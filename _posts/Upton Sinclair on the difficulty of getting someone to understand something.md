Upton Sinclair (September 20, 1878 – November 25, 1968) was an American writer, muckraker, political activist and the 1934 Democratic Party nominee for governor of California. He wrote nearly 100 books and other works in several genres. Sinclair's work was well known and popular in the first half of the 20th century, and he won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1943.

He has a quote that says, "It’s difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it,” which I think is brilliant. It's another way of saying, 'carefully look at the incentives'.
