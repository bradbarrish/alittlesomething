You’ve probably heard me talk about [Kevin Kelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Kelly_(editor)) before. He’s one of my favorite thinkers, futurists, technologists, etc. He is many things, but to me, he one of the most inspirational people about the future. He has a wonderful blog and many wonderful books. He has a post on his blog called, “[You Are Not Late](https://kk.org/thetechnium/you-are-not-late/),” which you should go read in its entirety. I especially like this bit though:

> So, the truth: Right now, today, in 2014 is the best time to start something on the internet. There has never been a better time in the whole history of the world to invent something. There has never been a better time with more opportunities, more openings, lower barriers, higher benefit/risk ratios, better returns, greater upside, than now. Right now, this minute. This is the time that folks in the future will look back at and say, “Oh to have been alive and well back then!”

It doesn’t matter what year it is. Swap out 2014 with whatever year it is when you’re reading it (I’m writing it in 2025).
