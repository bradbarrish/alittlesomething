Always be inquisitive. Ask people questions, especially strangers. A lot of people like talking about themselves, so it’s a great way to be friendly toward strangers in social settings. Mom likes to poke fun at me because I almost never ask what people do and play a game with myself to see if I can avoid the question altogether, though it somehow inevitably comes up because people associate what they do with their identity. It makes many people feel important, especially people with big fancy job titles. It’s ok to be proud of what you do in life, but you are not defined, at least not in my eyes, by what you do.
