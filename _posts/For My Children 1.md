  * Cassidy and Ozzie - My dad kept a spiral notecard notebook that had quotes and thoughts and other bits of wisdom that he passed along to us. It is especially meaningful since he's no longer here and I can't have conversations with him. It gave (and continues to give) me insight into him as a person, not just as a parent. I cherish this notebook and this is my own attempt to pass along some inspiring knowledge and information to you both. Some of the stuff is linked to things on the open web, which will hopefully still be around by the time you begin reading all this stuff. It's the content that matters most, but if the links still work, they will give you some further insight into things. Nothing is in any real order. Maybe I’ll group them together in some way once there are too many to scroll though.
