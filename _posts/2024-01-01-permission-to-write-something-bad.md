We saw Billie Eilish play a concert this week at the Kia Forum. As it happened, she and Finneas were interviewed on [Fresh Air](https://www.npr.org/2024/12/17/1219887493/billie-eilish-finneas) this week and I was listening to it on the way to the office today. It was a good interview overall. You should listen to the whole thing. But one of the questions stuck out because it hit on something that Mama and Papa have been telling you since you could understand it â€“ there will be very few things that you will be good at right away. This can be really frustrating to you both. It's frustrating to me too! To know that highly successful, highly creative people struggle with this is, in some way, comforting.

Here's a clip from the podcast and the transcript.

_**Your mother, when she was home-schooling you, gave you classes on songwriting. Are there insights that she gave you both that stuck with you?**_

_Yeah, I mean, honestly, there was one thing that really helped me, which was our mom had us go home and watch something on TV or read something and just write down any interesting words that we see or an interesting sentence. And then kind of taking whatever you wrote and just try to make a song out of what you wrote or make a song about the thing that you thought was cool or about this one word or at least incorporating this one word into a song you already wrote. Just like new ways of kind of taking pressure off of yourself a little like that really helped me because songwriting always felt like a lot of pressure on me in myself alone._

_And I think that I don't know if Finneas would agree, but like something that I think has always helped in songwriting is giving yourself permission to write a bad song. I think that sometimes you have this high expectation for yourself and you're like, I don't know, it has to be really good. But you can't just sit down and make something perfect immediately every time._

_You have to try and fail. And that was something that was really hard for me. I'm not good at patience, and I'm not good at not being good at something until I am._

_I want to be really good immediately. And I think it's just something that helped me a lot is just allowing myself to not be amazing and just make something to make it and not worry if it's good._
