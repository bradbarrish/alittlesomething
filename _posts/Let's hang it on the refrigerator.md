[[Jeff Tweedy]] is the lead singer and songwriter of one of my favorite bands, [[Wilco]]. Mama likes them a lot too. Jeff used to in a band called [[Uncle Tupelo]], who I also really liked, but are more of an *acquired* taste. They never achieved the level of fame that Wilco (or Jeff) has. This quote is from [an interview he did in 2002](https://www.newsweek.com/where-theres-wilco-145799).
  
  >To say I’ve never been inhibited by expectations would be a lie. It’s more daunting to contend with yourself. It’s like saying I don’t even need to write songs because the greatest songwriter in the world has already done this – Bob Dylan. But he’s dealing with himself, too. The internal stuff is the stuff that kills you. I want to write the greatest song in the world sometimes. I don’t think there’s anything wrong in wanting to do that, but I think you’re better off when you realize you have no control over it. You just gotta keep making shit up, scribbling—like sitting down and drawing with my kids. It reminds me to do that in my songs. It doesn’t matter if it’s good or bad. I think it looks great. Let’s hang it on the refrigerator.
