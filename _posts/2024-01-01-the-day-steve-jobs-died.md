I was at work, sitting at my desk when a co-worker said "Steve Jobs is dead." It felt like someone punched me in the gut and I couldn't say a word. I was stunned. I knew it would happen in the near future, but I wasn't prepared for the emotion it stirred in me. I stared at Twitter for quite a while. The outpouring was intense. Still is. It feels strange to be so impacted by it all, but I am. I've never met Steve, but as anyone who knows me will attest, I love Apple products. There isn't another company who's products I love more and feel so a part of than Apple.

I have been using Apple computers since I was a child and certainly as long as I've been able to purchase my own computers. When I was a child my parents put me in computer class. Whatever their reason, I am forever grateful. I learned BASIC programming on an Apple IIe. I even have a certificate of completion for the class somewhere in my personal archives. That single class was one of the most inspirational points of my life and planted the seed of curiosity around computers that would drive lead me to where I am today. Yes, it could have happened on another kind of computer, but it didn't. And I've never forgotten about my first experience with an Apple computer.

As a kid I was obsessed with computers and electronics and spent as much time as I could with other neighborhood kids that had computers. I would take things apart to figure out how they worked. I played with phones a lot and did my fair share of phreaking, spending time on bulletin board systems (BBS) and just tinkering. I had an email address in the 90s while still in high school. I started college in 1993, the year Mosaic came into existence and from that point on I have been an active and obsessive participant in Internet culture, media and technology.

Steve and Apple have inspired me in innumerable ways. Through brilliance in design, Steve and Apple have made machines feel more alive. More human. More beautiful. The painstaking attention to countless details like curves of a computer, position and shape of keys on a keyboard, visual indicators, materials and on and on and on have taught me to appreciate design. They've inspired me to pay attention to minute details that other people don't care about. Steve has taught me that boring is not ok. I wish I could express all of the ways my life has been changed by Steve and Apple products. It's an odd feeling to know that one has been so impacted by a single brand. A brand. A company who makes things. But I know I'm not alone. Not anymore. Even though Apple has grown to be one of the most successful and profitable companies in the world, I still feel like it's a small club. For whatever reason, it still feels like rooting for the underdog. And I will never stop.

One of the other reasons Steve's death is particularly impactful is because of how he died. Pancreatic cancer. My dad also died of pancreatic cancer in his early 60s. Both good men that made the world a much better place and inspired so many people. They died way too young because of a particularly awful and virtually untreatable form of cancer. My heart goes out to Steve's family, friends and Apple employees.

A few of my favorite quotes:

> The only way to do great work is to love what you do.

> Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to make the big choices in life.

> Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.

> The problem with the internet start-up craze isn't that too many people are starting companies; it's that too many people aren't sticking with it. That's somewhat understandable, because there are many moments that are filled with despair and agony, when you have to fire people and cancel things and deal with very difficult situations. That's when you find out who you are and what your values are.

> So when these people sell out, even though they get fabulously rich, they're gypping themselves out of one of the potentially most rewarding experiences of their unfolding lives. Without it, they may never know their values or how to keep their newfound wealth in perspective.

> Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, it's really how it works. The design of the Mac wasn't what it looked like, although that was part of it. Primarily, it was how it worked. To design something really well, you have to get it. You have to really grok what it's all about. It takes a passionate commitment to really thoroughly understand something, chew it up, not just quickly swallow it. Most people don't take the time to do that.

> You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something – your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.
